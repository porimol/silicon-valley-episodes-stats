## Viewership Statistics
### Season-wise Summary Statistics

```{r season-summary, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)

# make sure dates are Date class
all_seasons <- all_seasons %>%
  mutate(`Original release date` = as.Date(
    `Original release date`, "%B %d, %Y"
  ))

season_stats <- all_seasons %>%
  group_by(Season) %>%
  summarise(
    Episodes       = n(),
    `First release`= format(min(`Original release date`), "%b %d, %Y"),
    `Last release` = format(max(`Original release date`), "%b %d, %Y"),
    `Avg viewers`  = mean(`U.S. viewers (millions)`),
    `Min viewers`  = min(`U.S. viewers (millions)`),
    `Max viewers`  = max(`U.S. viewers (millions)`),
    `Total viewers`= sum(`U.S. viewers (millions)`)
  )

knitr::kable(
  season_stats,
  caption = "Basic statistics for each Silicon Valley season",
  digits  = 2,
  align   = "c"
)
```

**Silicon Valley**'s averaged highest U.S. viewership in Season 2 (1.80 M per episode, peaking at 2.13 M) before a gradual decline to just 0.42 M in Season 6. Seasons 1â€“3 each viewership totals (13.77â€“17.98 M viewers) over 8â€“10 episodes, while Seasons 4â€“6 saw both fewer viewers per episode (0.75â€“0.81 M) and smaller cumulative audiences (2.92â€“8.12 M). The data show an initial growth in season 1 through Season 2, modest erosion in Season 3, then a steep drop-off in Seasons 4â€“6.

## Viewership Over Time

```{r viewership-plot, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)

# Parse the release dates into Date class
all_seasons$`Original release date` <- as.Date(
  all_seasons$`Original release date`,
  format = "%B %d, %Y"
)

# Plot viewers vs. release date
ggplot(all_seasons, aes(x = `Original release date`,
                        y = `U.S. viewers (millions)`)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    title = "Silicon Valley: U.S. Viewership Over Time",
    x     = "Original Release Date",
    y     = "Viewers (millions)"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

Viewership climbed to a peak of just over 2 million per episode around Seasons 1â€“3 (2014â€“16) before falling below 1 million in Season 4 and tapering off further to under 0.5 million by Season 6.


## Average U.S. Viewership by Season

```{r season-summary-plot, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

# Recompute season-wise stats with clean names
season_stats <- all_seasons %>%
  mutate(`Original release date` = as.Date(
    `Original release date`, "%B %d, %Y"
  )) %>%
  group_by(Season) %>%
  summarise(
    Episodes     = n(),
    avg_viewers  = mean(`U.S. viewers (millions)`),
    min_viewers  = min(`U.S. viewers (millions)`),
    max_viewers  = max(`U.S. viewers (millions)`)
  )

# Plot
ggplot(season_stats, aes(x = factor(Season), y = avg_viewers)) +
  geom_col() +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = min_viewers, ymax = max_viewers), width = 0.2) +
  labs(
    title = "Average U.S. Viewership by Season",
    x     = "Season",
    y     = "Viewers (millions)"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

Average viewership peaks around 1.8 M in Season 2 with the widest episode to episode swing and then steadily declines to just over 0.4 M in Season 6, with Season 4â€“6 all averaging under 1 M viewers.


## Silicon Valley : U.S. viewers per episode (millions) by Season

```{r viewers-per-episode-facets, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)

# make sure we have Season as a factor
all_seasons$Season <- factor(all_seasons$Season)

ggplot(all_seasons, aes(
    x = `No. overall`,
    y = `U.S. viewers (millions)`
  )) +
  geom_col(aes(fill = Season), width = 0.8) +
  facet_wrap(~ Season, nrow = 2, scales = "free_x",
             strip.position = "top") +
  scale_fill_brewer("Season", palette = "Set1") +
  labs(
    title = "Silicon Valley : U.S. Viewers per Episode (millions)",
    x = "Episode (overall number)",
    y = "Viewers (millions)"
  ) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 12) +
  theme(
    strip.background   = element_rect(fill = "grey95", color = NA),
    strip.text         = element_text(face = "bold", size = 12),
    axis.text.x        = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),
    panel.grid.minor   = element_blank(),
    legend.position    = "none"
  )
```

Across six seasons, episode viewership held strong at roughly 1.5â€“2 million in Seasons 1â€“3, dipped into the 0.6â€“1 million range in Seasons 4â€“5, and slid below half a million by Season 6.
