## Episodes Statistics

![Logo source: <https://www.tvinsider.com/show/silicon-valley/>](logo.jpg)

***Silicon Valley*** is an American comedy series that follows a socially awkward programmer, `Richard Hendricks`, and his eclectic team as they try to build and scale their innovative compression startup, **Pied Piper**, in the ruthless world of tech. The show satirizes startup culture, venture capital absurdities, and the often cutthroat dynamics of [Silicon Valley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Silicon_Valley_episodes).
